# make targets for the workbench, for any repository's Makefile to include:
#
#   WORKBENCH_HOME ?= <path to a devcontainer-airlock clone>
#   -include $(WORKBENCH_HOME)/host/workbench.mk
#
# Each target calls host/workbench next to this file, for the repository
# `make` runs in (its main clone, so its worktrees are included). Every target
# is named for the workbench, so none collides with a repository's own
# (`up` and `down` are often taken). `make <Tab><Tab>` lists them.
#
# checkmake reads only the first physical line of a .PHONY declaration, so
# this one stays on one line.
